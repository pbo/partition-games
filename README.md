# partition-games
This is a small toolbox, written in Haskell, for the computer modelling of the topological parameters of trinomial networks, as defined in the article:

Goryashko, A., Samokhine, L., Bocharov, P. (2019). **New Deterministic Model of Evolving Trinomial Networks.** In: Aiello, L., Cherifi, C., Cherifi, H., Lambiotte, R., Li√≥, P., Rocha, L. (eds) Complex Networks and Their Applications VII. COMPLEX NETWORKS 2018. Studies in Computational Intelligence, vol 812. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05411-3_45

The same toolbox was also used in another article of mine:

P. Bocharov, A. Goryashko, E.V. Nikulchev. **Partition Games as Contests: Numerical Simulation Tesults**. Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 9, 2015, no. 104, 5149-5167. http://dx.doi.org/10.12988/ams.2015.56415
